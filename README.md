# ![talkspritefinalanimateESXPORTEMPT](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a95f5277-ce2f-433e-991e-4c0d49018823) Hello! I'm _Mongo_

I make games with **Gamemaker**! 

Until late 2022, I used to just be an artist, but I got into GML so that I could finally stop being that person who "wants to make a game someday." It's been really fun to learn, and I have stuck with it ever since.

All of my game project repos are private, but I'll occasionally make small stuff I've made like asset packs or little prototypes public.
